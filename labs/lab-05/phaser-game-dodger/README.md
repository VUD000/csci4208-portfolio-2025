So I think that this lab was very useful in terms of learning object oriented programming for front end.
This lab is a really good template for me to use for potentially other projects to put on my portfolio due to the structure.
What I can say... is that the typos or inconsistencies in the PDF file has REALLY made my head spin like backtground for example.
