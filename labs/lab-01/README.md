When looking at HTML for the first time, it would be really daunting as a programmer as there are so many foreign things to look at and think about. But the more you program with, HTML seems really easy to create pages and such. I do think that knowing about HTML is super fundamental with stepping into the frontend world, and this lab just did the job. Working with HTML can be a little bit annoying to learn, but that is how things go when they are so foreign. But with this lab, getting through HTML is much better and the dact that this is a game, makes it more engaging.
